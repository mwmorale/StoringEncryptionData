# DataEncryption

Welcome!
Here, I am working with some very basic encryption. This is a work in progress. Eventually, this project will be merged with my folder locker so that an encypted file can be stored in a "locked" directory/folder. Avoid personal use for I am releasing the encyption key and/or "cipher solution" in my code. In order to use, the file called "RUN_ME.py" should be used.
